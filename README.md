## Overview

### Purpose

For gym users who want to explore, save, and generate new workouts. Our fitness app is a health and wellness app that provides a streamlined personalized workout experience catering to diverse workout needs. Users can explore a vast array of workouts and exercises, tailoring their routines to fit their preferences on difficulty, duration, and targeted muscle groups. With the option to create custom workouts and incorporate exercises from our database, users have the flexibility to design routines that suit their personal needs and goals. The app also fosters a social community where users can discover and share workout ideas, adding a collaborative aspect to their fitness journey. Furthermore, our search feature allows users to pinpoint exercises based on specific muscle groups and equipment needed, ensuring success in their own personal fitness journey.
